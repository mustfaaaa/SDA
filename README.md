The provided code demonstrates a low coupling design in object-oriented programming through the use of classes that interact with each other in a minimal and flexible way. Hereâ€™s a concise explanation focusing on low coupling:

Key Concepts
Encapsulation:

The Author class encapsulates the author's details (in this case, just the name). The name field is private, ensuring that it can only be accessed through the public method getName(). This promotes data hiding.
Dependency Injection:

The BlogPost_with_Lowcoupling class takes an Author object as a parameter in its constructor. This means that the BlogPost_with_Lowcoupling class does not create an Author instance itself but instead relies on an external instance. This reduces the dependency between the two classes.
Loose Coupling:

The BlogPost_with_Lowcoupling class is loosely coupled to the Author class because it only knows about the Author interface (i.e., the methods it can call, such as getName()) rather than its implementation details. This allows for easier changes or replacements of the Author class without affecting the BlogPost_with_Lowcoupling class.
Flexibility and Reusability:

If the requirements change (e.g., if an Author has more properties or methods), the BlogPost_with_Lowcoupling class does not need to change if it continues to interact with the Author class through its public interface.
Conclusion
By following the principles of encapsulation and dependency injection, the code illustrates low coupling, which enhances maintainability, flexibility, and reusability of the classes involved. Each class has a clear responsibility, and changes in one class are less likely to impact the other, adhering to the open/closed principle of software design.
